## Technologies used

This app was created for the UC Berkeley Full Stack Development course. It utilizes the following technologies:

1. Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API with the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture;
   1a) Node allows us to access Handlebars, our template engine, and Express allows us to use session, to store useful user input (excluding passwords) when logged in in cookies;
2. Dotenv, a Node.js library, to protect private data and secure the app, along with authentication processes;
3. Jest, a Node.js library, to test certain methods before using them;
4. Handlebars.js as our template engine;
5. MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for our database to store user data and their content, and
6. ESLint, which makes codes more consistent and avoids bugs.
